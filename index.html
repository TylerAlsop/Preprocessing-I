    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>When I'm not out camping or traveling I spend my time building things. That ranges from websites to an entire attic in my garage and a full playground in my brother's basement. Building things is my passion.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Utah so I've had a lot of opprotunity for mountainous adventures and risky red-rock expeditions. I've come to love the outdoors and all of the beauty and adventure it offers. </br>
    My wife has also taught me the joys of travel and in our first two years together we traveled to 21 foreign countries and 20 States in the USA.</p>

        <h3>Building Things</h3>
        <p>I've always had a knack for designing and building things. I am always looking for ways to improve my day to day life. I built an attic for my garage, an intricate budget reporting program in excel, TV dinner trays for my living room, etc. etc.</p>
