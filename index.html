    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>When I'm not out camping or traveling I spend my time building things. That ranges from websites to an entire attic in my garage and a full playground in my brother's basement. Building things is my passion.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Utah so I've had a lot of opprotunity for mountainous adventures and risky red-rock expeditions. I've come to love the outdoors and all of the beauty and adventure it offers. </br>
    My wife has also taught me the joys of travel and in our first two years together we traveled to 21 foreign countries and 20 States in the USA.</p>
